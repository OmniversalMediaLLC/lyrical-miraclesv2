Yo
Wolf Nation, the Bird Tribes have returned
Wake up, Neo
You're dreaming

There's never gonna be anyone but you and this demon
Everybody's sources out, but hope speaks, hear the meaning
Every devil you believe in keeps sneaking for reapings
To complete every season before you can even speak

It's like a week in between
I know it's deep, but every week isn't unique, so just believe in Namasteek
At least this beat is for those weak and in need of more than bleak energies
I know this speaks because it speaks

No need to get on your knees
Do not delete or retreat from anything
Here's the link
If you need me, I'm there

There's not a mountain
I won't climb to
Keep you breathing this air
Because I care too much
To let these beasts act up
The vultures looming
Seek to ruin you and us
So what
I'll be the druid
You review
And then repeat back
Once
Listen

We won't talk about this
I know it's hard for you to hear, but you are stronger than this
Hold on to me and every soul you hold off of my lips
I keep believing in you till you sing along and resist

We won't talk about this
I know it's hard for you to hear, but you are stronger than this
Hold on to me and every soul you hold off of my lips
I keep it leaving in you till you sing along and resist

We won't talk about this
I know it's hard for you to hear, but you are stronger than this
Hold on to me and every soul you hold off of my lips
I keep it leaving in you till you sing along and resist

Yo, I wrote these lyrics to de-confuse you
I know I need each month
To write a song, but all along it wasn't wrong to hunt for some way out of the mud
I know you're stuck, but to be blunt, I found a towel that brings luck
Let's roll it up and see what this moon's about this month

Another cycle of revival is about to erupt
I know you feel it in your spirit
I wrote these lyrics in the air until it hears you
Here's my prayer

Yo, have a spirit if you dare to stay aware
We're almost there
I will not tear away your dreams
My words are harsh

I know they seem too mean to really be believed
But to be fair, it's what we need
Just know that this return of kings took too much for me to screen
Every caller I hear raining on my line

Everything throws me off, so I seem to ignore the best of y'all much too often in this scene
```
