Yo
When these lyrics hit your ear
They interfere with what you hear
Cause Hawk Eye's back attacking queers
These tracks are packed with facts, my dear
My tongue attracts you with its clear
Combat vernacular skill
Cuz even Dracula can feel
My fuckin' Black Magick is still
Much too real for him to kill
Powers I wield Seal the Deal
Before the Incantation's done
I probably will reveal I'm thrilled
To put the Devil in his place
And make several different Faiths
Reassess the situation
All Creation hesitates
When I speak, All Seven Great
Spirits leave from Heaven's Gates
Just to make sure they can hear
This lyrical genius create
Songs too Loud to be turned down
All around who hear the sound
Of my voice have no choice
But to be Proud of these Profound
Bars I spit to Cage the Demons
Verses saying, with Vehement
Words I work around the clock
To over-complicate the meaning
Of each Lock they see me cleaning
Yeah - They ought to stop believing
That I won't cock it back and squeeze
Off a few shots before I leave
I'm the Warden with the Keys
Around my neck - Respect it please
Or I'll infect each fucking section
With selections up my sleeve
Then inject a Cure for free
To resurrect you whores and seize
Your Collective means of Protective Measures
Here's what you'll need
If you wanna survive, Every one of you hide
Beneath the covers when you see me walking by - or you'll Die
Teach each other to fear The Birds of Prey and steer clear
Of attracting attention - Did I mention - Do Not draw near
To the doors of your Cell - 'Cuz you just thought this was Hell
But I can tell you all that Satan's not doin' too well
He's a bit under the weather - All you Demons should pray
That you don't piss me off or let me hear you speaking his name
This - Binding Spell can't be broken, So you can't escape
But I can Alter it a bit if you wanna be Brave
Your Leader has been digging Graves Every Day
And I'll lay all of you down in 'em 1 by 1  - If you stray
You never thought I'd Return - But now you're all gonna Learn
Why Hawk Eye is the Warlord flicking Ashes in Urns
My tongue of Fire - It burns
And while you perspire, I yearn
To Remind you fuckin' Puppets what's Required - In turn
It's My desire is to make sure all you Liars are Spurned
Instead of worshiped by these Serpent led Choirs - Discern
Just what inspired these Words
Earth is Tired of Germs
Psychically infecting minds of Humans wired from Birth
To Reject all Recollection of their Soul and it's Worth
That's why I'm here to Resurrect my Tribe and get Directly to Work

Yeah - Motherfuckers
When I say move
You move

So all evil stand down, cause I am Legally Bound
To use Lethal Force if necessary - You heathens astound
Me with the way you killed Jesus -  But I'm not him - Best believe it
I'll kill your whole fuckin' Legion With these Phoenician Excretions
My tongue deletes each one of you weak motherfuckers through speakers
Turned to the Max - my villainy has reached another peak season
So when you see this ingenious rhyme scheme that I keep repeating
Its too late for you fucks to do much to extinguish
This dragon speech is the meanest shit you can read - if it seems
It's intentionally aimed at you its cause I'm through takin scenic
Routes to your house just to clean it, I'll burn it down first then leave it
Up to you to figure out how to get out once it's heated
You need to know that I can cast my magical plans
Across the web and kill The Feds with just the words that I've said
You know I don't give a damn about your Uncle Sam
So Shut the Fuck up or in my Trunk you'll be stuffed like a Clam
My craft is too much for you bitches so just listen - I'm wishing
For all you dark workers and witches to come witness this vision
My tongue is itching to mention that my intentions are vicious
So be suspicious of these twisted sentences I've invented
Cuz when I Finish this dentistry class, you little apprentices
Will be too appalled by all the ways my lyrics diminished
This damn political business and all its literal interest
In bullshit till every one becomes cynical isn't it
Fuckin' strange how in minutes  my word games came and ended this
Mind Controlling System's Pseudo-Knowledge - Saving the innocent
From the hand of the enemy - I can't stand to see any free
Human Being too confused to be True to their Inner G
Who are you to keep sending these made up rules to Me
Isn't the fact that I am now attacking your whole crew proof I will not be
pushed around by you clowns - I'll tear your whole system down
So stop pretending you're defending anything but your crown
My words are weapons used aggressively to express the shit
You keep neglecting so expect to be correctively hit
With these effective rhyme's I'm stressing in this message - You get
To hear my lesson's every second till you peasants repent
```
