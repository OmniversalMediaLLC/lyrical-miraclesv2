Yeah
I'm on a mission and I've been gifted
With a prescription to come and cure your condition
It's all been scripted by politicians
My trigger fingers itch and aiming at the Masonic vision
I'm on a mission and I've been gifted
With a prescription to come and cure your condition
It's all been scripted by politicians
My trigger fingers itch and aiming at their Masonic vision

These lawless entities were sent for me but I don't give a fuck
Come try to intervene by any means do anything you want
I'll fuck you up and that's not a threat I promise
I promise all of you when I erupt I'll take out all of you
Governmental scum there ain't no bitch in me
My history should prove that I am done
I'm not even listening my mission seems more important than dumb

Shit you jackass little children come up with
So you should run away before I say about six more things
Just shut you up I'll never bow down on the knee
Acquiesce or fold you'll need a hundred thousand men more bold than me
Look I already told you I'm not playing do you
You hear what I am saying to you
Matrix agents learn the basics you should take it slow
Fuck your authority sorority girls like you keep crying

Look you are boring me and you need to man up and
Quit trying to make these charges stick without a bit of legit reason
Why your wounded egotistical bullshit means that I should die

I'm on a mission and I've been gifted
With a prescription to come and cure your condition
It's all been scripted by politicians
My trigger fingers itching aiming at their Masonic vision

Let's face it they hate it a vibe so pervasive
Embrace this abrasive breaking out the matrix
The agents they play tricks detain us and take statements
Ordaining foundations unchanging displacing complacence
Remaining impatient these cases won't make it

You staged it you status I claim it a payment
You cannot negate this save it to pages
I sign I'm famous I'm a wild man I'm out of here
Fierce one you brought it on I call it out you're fraught upon

Quick like the Autobahn I'm wiser yeah you're catching on
Higher than your echelon 
Breathe fire -  yeah you best all run
Cause I'm tired of your lexicon wild man out

I'm on a mission and I've been gifted
With a prescription to come and cure your condition
It's all been scripted by politicians
My trigger fingers itching - Aiming at their Masonic Vision
