This is Mind Kontrol
This is Mind Kontrol
This is - This is - Mind Kontrol
This is Mind Kontrol
This is - This is Mind Kontrol

This is - This is - This is Mind Kontrol
If you don't control your mind
Your mind's controlling you
This is - This is Mind Kontrol

Let me tell you motherfuckers what it is
I'm not about to mince words in this verse just so it fits
I'll rap in cursive to disperse this shit
Then reverse the flow a bit and show you
It's so wicked when this
Rhyme finds its way in your mind
Cause you won't ever get it out
And I doubt this line
Will just let you keep forgetting, I am spitting Krystal Klear
Lyrical poetic messages I whisper in your ears

I'm here to speak the truth
Till they kill me there's no use
In trying to stop me, and I ought to be
A lot more free to choose
What I fucking say, but if they don't approve
The public just agrees when they see me on the news
I'm a domestic terrorist interfering with my lips
Conspiracy theories that I've been pushing to the kids
Telling everyone to get a gun and wear it on their hips
I must be stopped so call the cops and insist
They shoot me on sight cause even if I don't fight
I'm a threat you must eliminate before I take flight
See I'm a menace to society so dangerous, I might
Convince the whole fucking planet to rebel and reunite

This is - This is Mind Kontrol

This is - This is - This is Mind Kontrol
If you don't control your mind
Your mind's controlling you
This is - This is Mind Kontrol

Human sheep still asleep
Hear me speaking to the beat
As I creep between the sheets
Of their minds I repeat
It's time to wake the fuck up
Each line is uniquely
Designed to de-hypnotize
The blind and delete
The social conditioning
They promoted from birth
Emotional manipulations
That these Mason's insert
Into every facet of our lives until we invert
Our entire way of being
Just so we can go to work
We're trading hours of our lives
For currency we die
Imaginary, very scary numbered paper which decides
If we deserve to eat
Or even have a place to sleep
They took the world for themselves
And told us not to peek
How did we forget our souls buried deep inside
Incarnated with a purpose that these serpents try to hide
That's why I'm telling you it's worth it
Just to open your eyes
You've never seen below the surface
Of what's working to disguise
Religious fairy tales
And political divides
Keep the masses on a leash
But I release you with pride
It's my honor to stand before you speaking my mind
My sacred duty to renew your soul's beauty is divine

This is - This is Mind Kontrol

This is - This is - This is Mind Kontrol
If you don't control your mind
Your mind's controlling you
This is - This is Mind Kontrol
This is - This is Mind Kontrol

This is - This is - This is Mind Kontrol
If you don't control your mind
Your mind's controlling you
This is - This is Mind Kontrol

So lizards beware
I'm the wizard who ain't scared
To summon one hell of a blizzard
And come kill you in your lair
Bury you beneath the river
I'll deliver you there
So that your frozen body shivers
As it's quivering for air
Hawkeye is back
Yeah, you demons - It's a fact
After I wake up this Legion
These Phoenicians will attack
My strategic infiltration of this matrix was a trap
So tell your agents stand adjacent
Or I'll make them fall back
If I wasn't here then, maybe you could win
But your war against humanity's insanity friend
My soul is much too old for you to comprehend
And I've returned once again with all of my kin
That's seven billion souls reincarnated to end
Your rule upon this planet
We planned it to send
A message to the demons
In the box who pretend
They stand a chance to break free
Hey it's me again
You alien invaders are just pawns being used
By Wetiko to complete its ancient mission to confuse
The keepers of the keys
Hoping we forget to see
What's going on behind the curtain
Of our working CERN machine

This is - This is Mind Kontrol

This is - This is - This is Mind Kontrol
If you don't control your mind
Your mind's controlling you
This is - This is Mind Kontrol
