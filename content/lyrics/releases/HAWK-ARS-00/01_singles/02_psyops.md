Yo, this is for all you QAnon Followers

That Q shit got you fucked up, but I
Shoot this truth from my gun
Then when I'm through, no one gets abused
By the clues They keep dropping to confuse you

That Q shit got you fucked up, but I
Shoot this truth from my gun
Then when I'm through, no one gets abused
By the clues They keep dropping to confuse you

QAnon is a psyop, they have designed to quell riots
If anyone gets too violent, this spell compels you to silence
Them with a tale of compliance, no need to yell, just stay quiet
Trust the plan, all is well, Trump is the man, can't you tell

But this hope is a joke, you folks used to cope, so I wrote
This shit to smoke all you dopes, who just pretend to be woke
Know I intend to descend and put an end to this show
With just my pen, I'll dispense with this scenario

You think God's in control, is that what you've been told
This fuckin' puppet you trust in is just a dust in his throne
But when I bust in discussing blowing this trumpet, just know
They are reluctant to fuck with anyone that's this bold

That Q shit got you fucked up, but I
Shoot this truth from my gun
Then when I'm through, no one gets abused
By the clues They keep dropping to confuse you

That Q shit got you fucked up, but I
Shoot this truth from my gun
Then when I'm through, no one gets abused
By the clues They keep dropping to confuse you

No they can't stop us all, but they can keep us enthralled
With senseless shit that these hypnotists are equipped to install
As I witness this intricate bullshit, I'm appalled
By all these ignorant syndicates who forget I am called

To tear this system to pieces, just like Jesus - My scheme is
To delete these Elitist Swine who keep trying to lead us
Let me remind you, my speeches have been designed as Subpoenas
From on High - that's the reason my rhyme seems conceited

You want proof QAnon is just another mirage
You fucking goofs thing there's groups inside the Government on
Some fucking mission - keep wishing - this system isn't disarmed
By you submissive imprisoned bitches mentioned in this song

That Q shit got you fucked up, but I
Shoot this truth from my gun
Then when I'm through, no one gets abused
By the clues They keep dropping to confuse you

That Q shit got you fucked up, but I
Shoot this truth from my gun
Then when I'm through, no one gets abused
By the clues They keep dropping to confuse you

It's COINTELPRO meant to blind us, these stylists know that it's biased
This whole show is designed as blindfolds as they guide us
To the slaughter they've planned - So try harder to stand
Against this scripted bullshit that they have authored again

Never trust an Official that's not busting his whistle out and
Exposing these issues - I'm diagnosing with pencils
My mission's simple - So listen, this shit I'm spitting ain't fiction
It's my intention to mention - The definition of wisdom

Is to prevent superstition from inventing conditions
In which these ignorant Christians misrepresent their suspicions
I always meant to imprison these Pigeons with my Inscriptions
So my efficient description of this Religion is witnessed

That Q shit got you fucked up, but I
Shoot this truth from my gun
Then when I'm through, no one gets abused
By the clues They keep dropping to confuse you

That Q shit got you fucked up, but I
Shoot this truth from my gun
Then when I'm through, no one gets abused
By the clues They keep dropping to confuse you
